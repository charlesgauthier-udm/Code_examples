# Code_examples
A few examples of project I did
Here is a short summary of what each piece of code is/was about:
Code_CNN_exemple.py: A CNN coded to identify the center and radius of a circle.
Ising_Diffusion.py: Made as part of a project on the ising model and simulating the creation of a bit on a hard drive.
LW.py: Modeling of a gas leak on a grid, using the Lax-Wendroff method to solve the partial derivative equation of the leak
Projet_neurone.py: Modeling of neurons behavior, using Runge-Kutta method to solve ordinary differential equations
Reseau_neurone.py: Creation and training of a NN from scratch
algo_evolutif.py: Evolutionnary algorithm used to find parameters of an exoplanet from observations
galaxie_n_norps.py: N-Body problem, simulation of the formation of a galaxy 1e6 stars
